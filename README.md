# Zigbee Home

Project that aims to provide similar functionality to [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome), but for Zigbee devices.

# :information_source:  Note
`dev` branch is for experiments and exploration. 
It cannot be used to determine quality of resulting project.

## Status

Currently work is being carried to develop CLI application and adding sensors.

Priorities can be ordered as:
* Board(bootloader) support
* Adding known sensors
* Adding Zigbee clusters & templates for unavailable clusters in ZBOSS

### Source Generation
CLI can generate source, which can then be built and flashed.

"Source" includes C source code, app config(`proj.conf`) and overlay (`app.overlay`).

### Building
Assuming configuration file is located at `./zigbee_test.yml` and directory for generated & built firmware should be `./firmware` the command to generate & build the firmware will be:
```sh
go run ./cli/cmd/zigbee --config ./zigbee_test.yml firmware --workdir ./firmware build
```

Only source code can be generated by adding `--only-generate` flag after `build`:
```sh
go run ./cli/cmd/zigbee --config ./zigbee_test.yml firmware --workdir ./firmware build --only-generate
```

Note: `build` command will not clear the work directory, so if it already contains some additional files they may be used while building the firmware.

This also applies when removing features from configuration and re-building the firmware: some files might be left after feature that requires it was removed.
It could lead to a build that is failing.

### Flashing
CLI can flash already built application with a couple of methods:
- nrfutil
- mcuboot
- west
- adafruit (if available in current PATH)

Device already has to be in a mode that will allow flashing(DFU, for example).

Example:
```sh
go run ./cli/cmd/zigbee --config ./zigbee_test.yml firmware --workdir ./firmware flash
```

### Supported devices

This project is being developed based on [nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dongle) from [Nordic Semiconductors](https://www.nordicsemi.com/)

Initial goal of the project is to support nRF52840 based devices, with expansion to nRF53 series.

* nRF52840 Dongle
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE (Sense). Probably also other Bossac bootloader devices on nrf52840 as well.
* Support for boards with Adafruit bootloader. Please read note below.

Support is provided for Adafruit bootloader, but is not comprehensevily tested.
This means that any device running Adafruit bootloader will run the firmware generated by this tool, 
but it cannot be fully guaranteed that the firmware will work properly on the device in all conditions.

Support was tested on my two boards with Adafruit bootloader(Arduino Nano 33 BLE & Seeed Xiao), and simple firmware was working correctly.

For Adafruit bootloader a UF2 file will be generated, which then can be flashed normally through drag-and-drop.

User can change configuration that allows bootloader support in `cli/types/board/known_boards.go`.


## Using in Home Assistant
[ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) integration can figure out device capabilities without pre-defined configuration.

Firmware provided by this project is already working on the Dongle and reporting defined values when connected through ZHA.

[Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) [recently](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/releases/tag/1.35.0) added ability to generate definitions for unknown devices, as ZHA does.
While it may not support all clusters and functionalities yet, there is active work going on to make support better.

## CLI

Go CLI application available in `/cli` will provide 
necessary options to build and upload firmware based on provided configuration.

For this to work user would need to already have nRF Connect SDK set up, with `west` and probably some flash tool applications available and working.

Defined flash tools are:
* `nrfutil` - already working
* `adadfruit`
* `mcuboot`
* `west` - already working

Default configuration file called `zigbee.yml` will be loaded 
and used to configure. 
See bare example in `cli/zigbee.yml`, or original configuration definition
in `cli/config/device.go:Device`.

To flash the board with built firmware run
```sh
go run ./cli/cmd/zigbee firmware --workdir <path_to_project> flash
```

Users can flash built applications with [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop) 
as well, if CLI tool is not suited for some cases.

This project needs nRF Connect SDK version 2.5.0. Other versions are not yet tested.
