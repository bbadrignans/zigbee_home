// This package provides functionality to define
// configuration option with their values, and also define
// dependencies on other configuration options.
//
// Configuration values are not ordered in the output,
// and dependencies are managed on very basic level.
//
// Configuration values already added to global list
// for now are treated as required, which is not
// necessarily correct.
