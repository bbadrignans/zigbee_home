// This package provides reasonable functionality to define
// overlay files for the boards.
//
// Primary purpose of this package is not to provide
// complete implementation of [Devicetree](https://www.devicetree.org/),
// but to allow features required by this project to be
// defined in code and then generated to an overlay file.
//
// It is highly possible that this will remain as low-level
// implementation of devicetree generator, while high-level
// package/type with required node definitions will be added later.
//
